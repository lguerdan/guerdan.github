I am a rising Junior at Mizzou, where I lead the [Mizzou Computing Association](https://mca.missouri.edu){:target="_blank"}, help organize [TigerHacks](https://tiger-hacks.com){:target="_blank"}, and conduct research at the [Distributed and Intelligent Computing Lab](http://dslsrv1.rnet.missouri.edu/~shangy/){:target="_blank"}.

This summer I am optimizing mapping anomaly detection at [Esri](http://www.esri.com/){:target="_blank"} and building off of work last summer at a National Science Foundation REU.
In the past I have [published work]({{ site.url }}/augmented-resource-allocation-mobilecloud17.pdf){:target="_blank"} enhancing disaster resource allocation, and have contributed to new methods of [detecting alcohol use](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7501676){:target="_blank"} and abuse.

I am interested in opportunities for using technology to improve wellbeing - some areas I think about a lot are behavior modeling, human computer interaction, and tech-based interventions in mental healthcare.
